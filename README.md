Uuuuuuh, Github wants my personal profile, I'm getting excited ;)

I'm Philipp Broschinski, currently unemployed and have been working in retail/sales for about 10 years. However, I've been interested in IT 
in all its forms since I was 13 years old. While it used to be games (from open-world games to first-person shooters), today it's more meaningful 
programs such as a home inventory management system or password generators. I'm aware of all kinds of security vulnerabilities and read daily 
articles on sites like heise.de or tarnkappe.net, or any other wonderful website that covers these topics.

I also have a basic understanding of programming. My only problem is my learning disability :/ It's almost like learning English. I know the words, 
sentence structure, tenses, and all the processes, but I need someone smarter, someone with more guts, to turn my ideas into code. That's where I 
use ChatGPT.

My dream is to transform the service desert of Germany into Germany 2.0. We need a reasonable infrastructure, better-informed users (I could take 
on this part, for example, since I read every day about what's missing), a real competence center that sets standards, etc.

It also annoys me to read every year that the most popular password of all time is "123456," followed by "password" ... That's why, with the help 
of ChatGPT, I created my PasswordGenerator1.0 on this account...

Anyone who wants to help is welcome to write to me personally. Every email will be read. But I also want to make it clear that I know how to expose 
scammers! My training in retail and my study of IT theory weren't for nothing. Also, recognizing code created by AI is currently very easy. That's 
why I don't hide the fact that I give my own ideas with improvements made by AI. Therefore, my codes are visible and usable by anyone.

So far, you can consider "our" code as open-source. But no one is allowed to use my code for commercial purposes. If so, OpenAI and I own the rights 
to any commercial use! However, since I have no interest in selling useful software seriously but rather making it available to everyone, I cannot 
agree to commercial use. There will also be no advertising in my private software because I hope to learn from it.

You can reach me by email at philipp.broschinski@outlook.de. Since I have a private life and don't check my emails frequently, don't expect me to 
see them every day. Saturdays seem the most reasonable, so I will only review emails that contain "Saturday" in the subject line.

C' y'all l8er eh :p
